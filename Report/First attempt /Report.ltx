\chapter{Mechanical Design}
The design of the container was a process that encompassed several months. This chapter will go through the entire mechanical design process, outlining the key aims, decisions and analysis behind the container design. 

During the mechanical design process, there were two different softwareâ€™s used: OpenSCAD and SOLIDWORKS. OpenSCAD is an open source software which is compatible with all major computer operating systems. This enabled the start of the design process to occur before the beginning of the Michaelmas Term. Furthermore, as mentioned in the introduction, using opensource software is a key tenant of this project as it needs to be replicable for teams worldwide. SOLIDWORKS however, is not open source, but was still used. This is because there is some key functionality in SOLIDWORKS which helps reduces the time needed on a few of the important steps (such as rendering photos, heat simulations and producing engineering drawings). However, as I will lay out further in the chapter, the main designs were completed on OpenSCAD, and they do hold enough information for a group elsewhere to replicate without significant difficulty. 

A key consideration was what processes would be needed for the manufacturing of the container. The engineering department has different facilities which could be useful including: a workshop with a CNC machine, multiple different3D printers, a mechanical workshop which I would be able to use along with an electrical workshop. These all were considered when designing the container and each will be mentioned during this chapter. 

The first stage of the design process was to outline a specification for the testing container. These specifications were drawn from the project brief, the literature review and discussion with my supervisor Professor Moritz Riede. The specification of the design is outlined below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The container must be able to accommodate a 30 mm x 30 mm substrate provided by AFMD research group.}
\item{The container must be leakproof to outside air.}
\item{The container must allow electrical connections from outside to connect to the substrate for measurements.}
\item{The container must enable the substrate to be heated to a given temperature*.}
\item{The container must have a window allowing light to be shone into the box.}
\item{The container must contain a gas inlet.}
\item{The container should fit into the small glovebox inlet with diameter 150 mm. }
\end{enumerate}
